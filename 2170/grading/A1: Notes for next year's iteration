-Feedback on some sort of drafting of reccommendations from audit report
-Arena board has useful examples
-Useful information about the assignment lives in different places across Q&A. lecture slides and other sources, is there a way to consolidate this information in one place
-Make assignment description more documentation having
-Students want Q&A in advance (something like that)
-Corpus of adequate websites from past iterations
-Want more detailed data cleaning examples 

-be more clear about how much to (and to explicitly articulate) articulate the criteria for rating, the sensibility for ranking the recommendations, and whereto put that in the writeup.
